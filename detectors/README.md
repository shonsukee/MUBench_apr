# MUBench : Detectors

MUBench integrates a number of API-misuse detectors that you can immediately run experiments with.
Each such detector has its own subdirectory of this directory.
The respective directory name corresponds to the Id of the detector, which you need to specify when [running experiments with the MUBench Pipeline](../mubench.pipeline/#run-experiments).

## Integrate Your Own Detector

To evaluate your own detector on MUBench, you need to [integrate the detector into the pipeline](../mubench.cli/).
