# Detector: Detecting Missing Method Calls (DMMC)

DMMC was developed by [Martin Monperrus](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/) and [Mira Mezini](http://www.stg.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/mira_mezini/). For details go to [the companion website for their publication "Detecting Missing Method Calls As Violations of the Majority Rule"](http://www.monperrus.net/martin/dmmc).

The original detector was extended by a runner that reads MUBench input and writes MUBench output.
