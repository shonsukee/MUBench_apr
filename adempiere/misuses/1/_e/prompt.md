## Instruction
You are a software engineer specializing in REST API.
Use the guidelines below to make any necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
0. First, familiarise yourself with the following steps and ### Notes.
1. Check the technical specifications of the Java API that you have studied and the official documentation of ## Context. If you don't know, output the ### Input Code as it is.
2. Based on the technical specifications of the Java API you have reviewed in step 1, identify the code according to the deprecated specifications contained in the ### Input Code. In this case, the deprecated specifications are the Java API calls that have been deprecated. If no code according to the deprecated specification is found, identify code with maintainability issues. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
3. If you find code according to the deprecated specification or maintainability issues in step 2, check the technical specifications in the Java API that you have studied and the official documentation of ## Context. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
4. With attention to the points listed in ### Notes below, modify the code identified in step 2 to follow the recommended specification analysed in step 3.
5. Verify again that the modified code works correctly.
6. If you determine that it works correctly, output the modified code.
7. If it is judged to fail, output the ### Input Code as it is.
8. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.

### Notes.
- You must follow the ## Context.
- `### Java API documentation` is official documentation and must follow.
- Be sure to fix any maintainability issues that exist.
- If Java API documentation include throws Exception, it must be handled.
- Bug exists in line 15 of the ## Input code.

## Input Code
```java
	public String encrypt (String value)
	{
		String clearText = value;
		if (clearText == null)
			clearText = "";
		//	Init
		if (m_cipher == null)
			initCipher();
		//	Encrypt
		if (m_cipher != null)
		{
			try
			{
				m_cipher.init(Cipher.ENCRYPT_MODE, m_key);
				byte[] encBytes = m_cipher.doFinal(clearText.getBytes());
				String encString = convertToHexString(encBytes);
				// globalqss - [ 1577737 ] Security Breach - show database password
				// log.log (Level.ALL, value + " => " + encString);
				return encString;
			}
			catch (Exception ex)
			{
				// log.log(Level.INFO, value, ex);
				log.log(Level.INFO, "Problem encrypting string", ex);
			}
		}
		//	Fallback
		return CLEARVALUE_START + value + CLEARVALUE_END;
	}	//	encrypt
```

## Context
### Java API documentation
```
getBytes
public byte[] getBytesâ€‹(Charset charset)
Encodes this String into a sequence of bytes using the given charset, storing the result into a new byte array.
This method always replaces malformed-input and unmappable-character sequences with this charset's default replacement byte array. The CharsetEncoder class should be used when more control over the encoding process is required.

Parameters:
charset - The Charset to be used to encode the String
Returns:
The resultant byte array
Since:
1.6
```
```
Standard charsets
Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the following standard charsets. Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any other charsets are supported. The behavior of such optional charsets may differ between implementations.

Charset	Description
US-ASCII	Seven-bit ASCII, a.k.a. ISO646-US, a.k.a. the Basic Latin block of the Unicode character set
ISO-8859-1  	ISO Latin Alphabet No. 1, a.k.a. ISO-LATIN-1
UTF-8	Eight-bit UCS Transformation Format
UTF-16BE	Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, big-endian byte order
UTF-16LE	Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, little-endian byte order
UTF-16	Sixteen-bit UCS Transformation Format, byte order identified by an optional byte-order mark
The UTF-8 charset is specified by RFC 2279; the transformation format upon which it is based is specified in Amendment 2 of ISO 10646-1 and is also described in the Unicode Standard.

The UTF-16 charsets are specified by RFC 2781; the transformation formats upon which they are based are specified in Amendment 1 of ISO 10646-1 and are also described in the Unicode Standard.

The UTF-16 charsets use sixteen-bit quantities and are therefore sensitive to byte order. In these encodings the byte order of a stream may be indicated by an initial byte-order mark represented by the Unicode character '\uFEFF'. Byte-order marks are handled as follows:

When decoding, the UTF-16BE and UTF-16LE charsets interpret the initial byte-order marks as a ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE; when encoding, they do not write byte-order marks.

When decoding, the UTF-16 charset interprets the byte-order mark at the beginning of the input stream to indicate the byte-order of the stream but defaults to big-endian if there is no byte-order mark; when encoding, it uses big-endian byte order and writes a big-endian byte-order mark.

In any case, byte order marks occurring after the first element of an input sequence are not omitted since the same code is used to represent ZERO-WIDTH NON-BREAKING SPACE.
Every instance of the Java virtual machine has a default charset, which may or may not be one of the standard charsets. The default charset is determined during virtual-machine startup and typically depends upon the locale and charset being used by the underlying operating system.

The StandardCharsets class defines constants for each of the standard charsets.

## Output Indicator
Update the ### Input  Code as per the latest API specification, making necessary modifications.
Ensure the structure and format remain as close as possible to the original, but deprecated code must be updated. Output the all revised code without additional explanations or comments.
