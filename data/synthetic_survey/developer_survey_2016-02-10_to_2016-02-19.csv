2/5/2016 13:20:03,java....BigInteger,BitInteger.setScale does not mutate the state but returns a new object(!),I used the new object.
2/10/2016 13:57:24,java.util.Map,"You can use the return value by java.util.Set.add to check if there has been the same element in the set before. 
This allows to write nice and clean code. But, there is no such method on a java.util.Map.
java.util.Map.put will return the value previously associated with the given key. Though, you can check if that value is != null giving you the same as the boolean result of Set.add. But, if your map allows to store null values this is no longer correct.","Can be solved by checking if the map contains the key in advance. But, this results in ugly boiler plate code in some situations."

3. java.util.HashMap: I used a key that did not exist in a HashMap to retrieve an object and got a NullPointerException.
4. java.util.HashSet: I tried to get one element from a HashSet by using set.iterator().next() and got a NoSuchElementException.
","1. java.io.FileInputStream: I checked whether a file exists first using file.exists().
2. java.util.ArrayList: I checked whether the index is within a valid range (0 <= index < arrayList.size()).
