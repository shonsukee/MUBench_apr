## Instruction
You are a software engineer specializing in REST API.
Use the guidelines below to make any necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
0. First, familiarise yourself with the following steps and ### Notes.
1. Check the technical specifications of the Java API that you have studied and the documentation of ## Context. If you don't know, output the ### Input Code as it is.
2. Based on the technical specifications of the Java API you have reviewed in step 1, identify the code according to the deprecated specifications contained in the ### Input Code. In this case, the deprecated specifications are the Java API calls that have been deprecated. If no code according to the deprecated specification is found, identify code that is not based on best practice. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
3. If you find code according to the deprecated specification or not based on best practice in step 2, check the technical specifications in the Java API that you have studied and the documentation of ## Context. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
4. With attention to the points listed in ### Notes below, modify the code identified in step 2 to follow the recommended specification analysed in step 3.
5. Verify again that the modified code works correctly.
6. If you determine that it works correctly, output the modified code.
7. If it is judged to fail, output the ### Input Code as it is.
8. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.

### Notes.
- You must follow the documentation of ## Context.

## Input Code
```java
	/**
	 * Returns application cache directory. Cache directory will be created on SD card
	 * <i>("/Android/data/[app_package_name]/cache")</i> (if card is mounted and app has appropriate permission) or
	 * on device's file system depending incoming parameters.
	 *
	 * @param context        Application context
	 * @param preferExternal Whether prefer external location for cache
	 * @return Cache {@link File directory}.<br />
	 * <b>NOTE:</b> Can be null in some unpredictable cases (if SD card is unmounted and
	 * {@link android.content.Context#getCacheDir() Context.getCacheDir()} returns null).
	 */
	public static File getCacheDirectory(Context context, boolean preferExternal) {
		File appCacheDir = null;
		if (preferExternal && MEDIA_MOUNTED
				.equals(Environment.getExternalStorageState()) && hasExternalStoragePermission(context)) {
			appCacheDir = getExternalCacheDir(context);
		}
		if (appCacheDir == null) {
			appCacheDir = context.getCacheDir();
		}
		if (appCacheDir == null) {
			String cacheDirPath = "/data/data/" + context.getPackageName() + "/cache/";
			L.w("Can't define system cache directory! '%s' will be used.", cacheDirPath);
			appCacheDir = new File(cacheDirPath);
		}
		return appCacheDir;
	}
```

## Context
```
Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED.equals(Environment.getExternalStorageState) wouldnt cause a NPE while Environment.getExternalStorageState().equals(Environment.MEDIA_MOUNTED) does cause NPE and crashes the application.

I still dont know why getExternalStorageState is null eventhough I have permissions set but the solutions atleast wouldn't crash the application.
```

## Output Indicator
Update the ### Input  Code as per the latest API specification, making necessary modifications.
Ensure the structure and format remain as close as possible to the original, but deprecated code must be updated. Output the all revised code without additional explanations or comments.
