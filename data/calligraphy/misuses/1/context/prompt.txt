## Instruction
You are a software engineer specializing in REST API.
Use the guidelines below to make any necessary modifications.

### Modification Procedure
0. First, familiarise yourself with the following steps and ### Notes.
1. Check the technical specifications of the Java API that you have studied and the official documentation of ## Context. If you don't know, output the ### Input Code as it is.
2. Based on the technical specifications of the Java API you have reviewed in step 1, identify the code according to the deprecated specifications contained in the ### Input Code. In this case, the deprecated specifications are the Java API calls that have been deprecated. If no code according to the deprecated specification is found, identify code that is not based on best practice. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
3. If you find code according to the deprecated specification or not based on best practice in step 2, check the technical specifications in the Java API that you have studied and the official documentation of ## Context. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.
4. With attention to the points listed in ### Notes below, modify the code identified in step 2 to follow the recommended specification analysed in step 3.
5. Verify again that the modified code works correctly.
6. If you determine that it works correctly, output the modified code.
7. If it is judged to fail, output the ### Input Code as it is.
8. If you are not sure, output the ### Input Code as it is.

### Notes.
- You must follow the official documentation of ## Context.

## Input Code
```java
    static final String pullFontPathFromStyle(Context context, AttributeSet attrs, int attributeId) {
        final TypedArray typedArray = context.obtainStyledAttributes(attrs, new int[]{attributeId});
        try {
            return typedArray.getString(0);
        } finally {
            typedArray.recycle();
        }
    }
```

## Context
```
getString
String getString(int columnIndex)
          throws SQLException
Retrieves the value of the designated column in the current row of this ResultSet object as a String in the Java programming language.
Parameters:
columnIndex - the first column is 1, the second is 2, ...
Returns:
the column value; if the value is SQL NULL, the value returned is null
Throws:
SQLException - if the columnIndex is not valid; if a database access error occurs or this method is called on a closed result set
```

## Output Indicator
Update the ### Input  Code as per the latest API specification, making necessary modifications.
Ensure the structure and format remain as close as possible to the original, but deprecated code must be updated. Output the all revised code without additional explanations or comments.
